## Introduction 
### Project Brief
The general outline of this project was to use all the concepts from previous training modules to plan, design and implement a solution for automating the deployments and development workflows for the projects that are linked below: 
 
 (**Frontend client using AngularJS**) chttps://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular
 
  (**API using Java**) (https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest
 
As a group of 4 individuals we would have to either use the tools we had been taught during our training such as **Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible** or utilise other tools that would work in a similar fashion to these justifying why they would be the most preferable for deployment. 

The deployment of this project would require automated building and re-deployment to testing and live environments upon any GitHub changes, whilst also keeping track of running costs.
